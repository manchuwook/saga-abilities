# Mantine Theme Integration Improvements

## Problem Solved

We have streamlined how dark mode is handled in our application by eliminating redundant code and better integrating with Mantine's theme system. Previously, we had two separate systems for managing dark mode:

1. Mantine's built-in color scheme: `useMantineColorScheme()` providing `colorScheme` and `toggleColorScheme()`
2. Our custom StyleService maintaining its own dark mode state and exposing an `isDark` property

This duplication led to code that checked both systems and potential synchronization issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. StyleService Modifications

- Renamed internal `colorScheme` state to `_colorScheme` to make it clear it's a private implementation detail
- Provided the `isDark` getter that still works with existing code but uses the stored color scheme
- Modified theme component styling to use Mantine's theme context parameter more consistently
- Kept the `updateColorScheme` method for backward compatibility and testing

### 2. ThemeContext.tsx Improvements

- Removed redundant style service updates
- Simplified theme state management
- Ensured StyleService is properly initialized with theme changes

### 3. useStyles Hook Simplification

- Removed unnecessary theme initialization logic
- Used Mantine's color scheme directly for dark mode detection
- Continued to provide consistent interface to components

### 4. App.tsx Updates

- Switched from directly using `useMantineColorScheme` to our unified `useStyles` hook
- Removed redundant dark mode check

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Dark mode state now comes from Mantine's theme system
2. **Better Component Styling**: Component styles use the theme parameter consistently
3. **Simpler Mental Model**: Developers don't need to think about two parallel theme systems
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to theme handling are localized to the StyleService

## Usage Example

Instead of:

```tsx
const { colorScheme } = useMantineColorScheme();
const isDark = colorScheme === 'dark';
```

Now use:

```tsx
const { isDark } = useStyles();
```

This provides the same functionality but uses our unified styling system.
