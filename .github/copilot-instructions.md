# Copilot Instructions

This project is a web application that allows users to create and manage tasks. The application is built using React, Vite, Mantine, and Storybook. It uses static JSON files as the database.

## Coding Standards

- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for component names.
- Use single quotes for strings.
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use arrow functions for callbacks.
- Use async/await for asynchronous code.
- Use const for constants and let for variables that will be reassigned.
- Use destructuring for objects and arrays.
- Use template literals for strings that contain variables.
- Use the latest JavaScript features (ES6+) where possible.
- When running terminal commands, do not use "&&" to combine as this is not recognized by Windows PowerShell.
- Use design patterns that favor unit testing, such as dependency injection and separation of concerns.
- Use OpenAPI 3.x standards when creating backend web-based applications and APIs.
- Use JSDoc comments for functions and classes to describe their purpose and parameters.
- Use "TODO:" comments to indicate areas of the code that can benefit from unit testing.
- Use "FIXME:" comments to indicate areas of the code that need to be fixed or improved.
